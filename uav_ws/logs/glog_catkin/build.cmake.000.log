CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:9 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0053 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
